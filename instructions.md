    *   Open your web browser and go to the Supabase website: [https://supabase.com/](https://supabase.com/)
    *   Log in to your Supabase account.

2.  **Select Your Project:**

    *   Click on the "Table Editor" option.

4.  **Review Your Schema:**
    *   The Table Editor will display a list of all the tables in your database schema.
    *   Click on each table to view its columns, data types, and any constraints or indexes.
